# Phat Pigeon

**Aim**: To build a fun game that students at my programming club can easily understand and modify/build upon to create their own, unique games.

## My requirements:
- It must be written in python without an advanced game engine
- It must be kept very simple and easy to understand - a beginner python programmer could easily figure out what the code is doing and modify it
- It should incorporate a wide variety of programming fundamentals
- It should be intuitive to play
- It should be relatively enjoyable
- It should incorporate ideas such as a leaderboard to encourage the player to improve at the game

## Gameplay overview:
- The game is similar to 'flappy bird', but with the addition of a 'dive' mechanic, along with different obstacles and the added challenge of food, which decreases your ability to jump
